/\*\*

- This function implements a specific algorithm for solving a problem in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
-
- The algorithm follows these steps:
- 1.  Initialize necessary variables and data structures.
- 2.  Iterate through the input data to perform the required operations.
- 3.  Apply the core logic of the algorithm to manipulate the data.
- 4.  Return the result after processing the input data.
-
- Notes:
- - Ensure that the input data is in the expected format before calling this function.
- - The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input data.
- - The space complexity is O(1) if no additional data structures are used, otherwise it depends on the auxiliary space required.
-
- @param {Type} paramName - Description of the parameter.
- @returns {ReturnType} - Description of the return value.
