/**
 * This function implements a specific algorithm for solving a problem in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
 * 
 * The algorithm follows these steps:
 * 1. Initialize necessary variables and data structures.
 * 2. Iterate through the input data to perform the required operations.
 * 3. Apply the core logic of the algorithm to manipulate the data.
 * 4. Return the result after processing the input data.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - Ensure that the input data is in the expected format before calling this function.
 * - The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the input data.
 * - The space complexity is O(1) if no additional data structures are used, otherwise it depends on the auxiliary space required.
 * 
 * @param {Type} paramName - Description of the parameter.
 * @returns {ReturnType} - Description of the return value.
